This project builds off of the [xmega-firmware-framework](https://github.com/nonolith/xmega-firmware-framework) to add full duplex 1msps direct digital IO functionality via DMA and a universal synchronous transmitter / receiver periperal.

It is currently used in conjunction with a naive 434MHz oscillator / transmitter to enable [LibOut](https://github.com/ade-ma/LibOut) to control outlets remotely.

It may be fleshed out to include abstractions for well-structured digital communication protocols such as I2C and SPI.
